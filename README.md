## Introduction
Degradation in PEMFC catalyst layers is a major barrier to commercialization of fuel cell (FC) vehicles, 
especially due to voltage cycling from vehicle operations. Degradation results in multiple morphological 
effects in the catalyst layer (CL), including:
a.	Reduced Pt surface area (ECSA) due to Pt particle dissolution and coalescence
b.	Alloy metal dissolution in ionomer causing changes in ionomer properties
c.	Carbon support corrosion resulting in thinning and reduced porosity
d.	Ionomer degradation and thinning
e.	Membrane pinhole and crack formation

## Objective
This project seeks to develop a computation model to simulate CL operation. Analysis using this model will 
be performed to understand the magnitude and location of on the aforementioned morphological changes, and 
their corresponding impact on the operating CL.
